\section{Evolution Subject}
In this paper, we use CoCoME as evolution subject. CoCoME has been further evolved in various projects, using the existing Hybrid Cloud-based Variant and a new approach called Microservice-based Variant. The former is sufficiently presented in the official Technical Report of CoCoME. See \cite{SWB-469002735} for any information and implementation details.
\subsection{Hybrid Cloud-based Variant}
The hybrid cloud-based variant of CoCoME was developed in the DFG Priority Programme
Design For Future - Managed Software Evolution (SPP 1593) \cite{Goltz2015}. This variant of CoCoME is using Java EE technologies for both the frontend and the backend. The hybrid cloud-based variant used in this report is completely identical to the variant described in \cite{SWB-469002735}. 

\subsection{Microservice-based Variant}
%TODO Hier muss jetzt eine Übersicht rein, sobald MS fertig implementiert. Dies wird ähnlich zu Technical report sein!
vgl zu 2016,2 Since.. various research projects ggf aendern?
mit 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 gemeint ->?
