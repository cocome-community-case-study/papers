\chapter{Design Details for Evolution Scenarios}
In this chapter we provide the detailed design documentation for each of the evolution scenarios
introduced in the prior section. Sec. \ref{App} sketches the design decision for the Mobile App that provides a second sales channel next to the existing Pick-up Shop. Sec. \ref{Docker} describes the adaptive changes of using a Docker environment to simplify the update process. They are both based on, or at least use the Hybrid Cloud-based Variant of CoCoME \cite{HeinrichRostamiReussner2016_1000052688}. In contrast, Sec. \ref{MS} provides a detailed design documentation of a new architectural version of CoCoME. This perfective evolution scenario is realized based on the Microservice idea.

\section{Adding a Mobile App Client} \label{App}
Developing the Mobile App Client as an extension of CoCoME requires additional use cases. They are described in Sec. \ref{UseCasesMobileApp}. Sec. \ref{DesignMobileApp} describes extensions on design level. The content of this chapter mainly originates from \cite{schnabel}.

\subsection{Design of the Mobile App}\label{DesignMobileApp}
 Fig. \ref{ComponentApp} is the component of this evolution scenario. When adding the Mobile App client, the hybrid cloud-based variant of CoCoME did not have to be modified. Therefore, CoCoME is encapsulated in a single component. Simply the three web services \textit{WebService::Inventory::LoginManager, WebService::Inventory::Store and WebService::Inventory::Enterprise} used by the App Client are emphasized. The entire component diagram for the hybrid cloud-based variant is available in the Technical Report \cite{HeinrichRostamiReussner2016_1000052688}. 
 \\ Fig. \ref{ComponentApp} indicates that the AppShop requires an adapter to access the web services provided by CoCoME. This is because CoCoME uses SOAP/WS*-based web services which are not compatible with the technology used to implement the AppShop Client. A more detailed introduction about the technology used to implement the Mobile App Client can be found in \cite{schnabel}. 
  
 \begin{figure}[!h]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/appComponent.png}
	\caption{Component Diagram of the CoCoME Ecosystem After Adding the Mobile App Client}
	\label{ComponentApp}
\end{figure}

  The \textit{AppShopAdapter} consumes the three web services \textit{WebService::Inventory::LoginManager, WebService::Inventory::Store} and \textit{WebService::Inventory::Enterprise} and provides a Rest Api which is used by the actual \textit{AppShop}. The Rest Api contains endpoints to retrieve and process Credit Card, Enterprise and StockItem information. To implement \emph{UC14-16}, the Api also provides endpoints for user management and processing sales. 
  
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/appSearchSequence.png}
	\caption{Sequence Diagram of Searching an Item in the Mobile App Client}
	\label{SequenceAppSearch}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{SequenceAppSearch} shows the process of opening a page to search for an Item. The customer opens the \textit{WebShopClient} and triggers the "Search" function to search for an item. To open the page, the \textit{NavigatorMenu} must call the \textit{Navigator} which creates a pagestate object and passes the object to the page. This HTML page is now presented to the customer. To fill the page with information, i.e when searching for a \textit{ProductItem}, the page uses services provided by the \textit{ServiceHolder}. In this case, the \textit{ItemService} calls the responsible REST-Service of \textit{AppShopAdapter} which in turn retrieves the necessary information from the WSDL services provided by CoCoME.


Fig. \ref{SequenceAppSale} demonstrates how the Mobile App Client processes sales.  For the sake of clarity, the digram is simplified and only contains the most important calls. First, the customer searches for items (according to Fig. \ref{SequenceAppSearch}). By clicking on the desired Item, the according \textit{ItemPage} is shown. This page carries information about the Item. Here, the customer decides whether the Item should be added to the Shopping Cart or not. The last steps are repeated until the customer decides to proceed to the checkout. If not logged in, the customer gets forwarded to the \textit{LoginPage}. When successfully logged in, the customer clicks the \textit{BuyNow}-Button. The Sale process is finished as soon as the backend (CoCoME) has processed the sale.

\section{Using a Docker Environment} \label{Docker}

As shown in Fig. \ref{techStack}, using a Docker Environment affects the technology stack by adding additional layers. More detailed, the given CoCoME Stack is moved into the Docker Deamon, which runs a Linux distribution.The original parts of the stack, like Glassfish and the Java Virtual Machine, are still a part of the stack.
	
	\begin{figure}[!h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{img/tech_stack_CoCoME.png}
		\caption{Extended technology stack CoCoME}
		\label{techStack}
	\end{figure}
	
The Dockerfile defines an environment based on the latest version of Ubuntu 16:04. Maven, Git and Java are also installed using the standard Ubuntu package manager.\\
Git has two purposes: On the one hand it is used to download the most recent version of CoCoME.	On the other hand, it is used to download a prefabricated version of Glassfish that already includes domains and other adjustments required for CoCoME. Java is required by Glassfish and CoCoME as they need the Java Virtual Machine. Maven is needed to deploy the latest version of CoCoME onto the provided Glassfish servers.
	
	
	During the development, it was decided to implement and provide two different versions. The first version always pulls the most recent CoCoME source code from GitHub, downloads the entire dependencies with Maven, compiles and builds the project and finally deploys CoCoME on the Glassfish servers. As a consequence, creating and starting a Docker Container takes about one hour.\\
	In contrast, the second version only pulls a prefabricated version of CoCoME from GitHub. 
	Therefore, pulling the source code up to building the project is skipped. Maven does not have to be included in the technology stack. Solely, deploying CoCoME on the Glassfish server is necessary.\\
	This reduces the deployment time to a few minutes but has a disadvantage: The prefabricated version is updated manually. Therefore, it is sometime not the most recent version.\\
	By providing both, a fast deploying version and a current version, the user can choose what's the best for its situation.
