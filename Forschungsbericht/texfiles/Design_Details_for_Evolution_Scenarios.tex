\chapter{Design Details for Evolution Scenarios}
In this chapter we provide the detailed design documentation for each of the evolution scenarios
introduced in the prior section. Sec. \ref{App} sketches the design decision for the Mobile App that provides a second sales channel next to the existing Pick-up Shop. Sec. \ref{Docker} describes the adaptive changes of using a Docker environment to simplify the update process. They are both based on, or at least use the Hybrid Cloud-based Variant of CoCoME \cite{HeinrichRostamiReussner2016_1000052688}. In contrast, Sec. \ref{MS} provides a detailed design documentation of a new architectural version of CoCoME. This perfective evolution scenario is realized based on the Microservice idea.

\section{Adding a Mobile App Client} \label{App}
Developing the Mobile App Client as an extension of CoCoME requires additional use cases. They are described in Sec. \ref{UseCasesMobileApp}. Sec. \ref{DesignMobileApp} describes extensions on design level. The content of this chapter mainly originates from \cite{schnabel}.

\subsection{Design of the Mobile App}\label{DesignMobileApp}
 Fig. \ref{ComponentApp} is the component of this evolution scenario. When adding the Mobile App client, the hybrid cloud-based variant of CoCoME did not have to be modified. Therefore, CoCoME is encapsulated in a single component. Simply the three web services \textit{WebService::Inventory::LoginManager, WebService::Inventory::Store and WebService::Inventory::Enterprise} used by the App Client are emphasized. The entire component diagram for the hybrid cloud-based variant is available in the Technical Report \cite{HeinrichRostamiReussner2016_1000052688}. 
 \\ Fig. \ref{ComponentApp} indicates that the AppShop requires an adapter to access the web services provided by CoCoME. This is because CoCoME uses SOAP/WS*-based web services which are not compatible with the technology used to implement the AppShop Client. A more detailed introduction about the technology used to implement the Mobile App Client can be found in \cite{schnabel}. 
  
 \begin{figure}[!h]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/appComponent.png}
	\caption{Component Diagram of the CoCoME Ecosystem After Adding the Mobile App Client}
	\label{ComponentApp}
\end{figure}

  The \textit{AppShopAdapter} consumes the three web services \textit{WebService::Inventory::LoginManager, WebService::Inventory::Store} and \textit{WebService::Inventory::Enterprise} and provides a Rest Api which is used by the actual \textit{AppShop}. The Rest Api contains endpoints to retrieve and process Credit Card, Enterprise and StockItem information. To implement \emph{UC14-16}, the Api also provides endpoints for user management and processing sales. 
  
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/appSearchSequence.png}
	\caption{Sequence Diagram of Searching an Item in the Mobile App Client}
	\label{SequenceAppSearch}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{SequenceAppSearch} shows the process of opening a page to search for an Item. The customer opens the \textit{WebShopClient} and triggers the "Search" function to search for an item. To open the page, the \textit{NavigatorMenu} must call the \textit{Navigator} which creates a pagestate object and passes the object to the page. This HTML page is now presented to the customer. To fill the page with information, i.e when searching for a \textit{ProductItem}, the page uses services provided by the \textit{ServiceHolder}. In this case, the \textit{ItemService} calls the responsible REST-Service of \textit{AppShopAdapter} which in turn retrieves the necessary information from the WSDL services provided by CoCoME.


Fig. \ref{SequenceAppSale} demonstrates how the Mobile App Client processes sales.  For the sake of clarity, the digram is simplified and only contains the most important calls. First, the customer searches for items (according to Fig. \ref{SequenceAppSearch}). By clicking on the desired Item, the according \textit{ItemPage} is shown. This page carries information about the Item. Here, the customer decides whether the Item should be added to the Shopping Cart or not. The last steps are repeated until the customer decides to proceed to the checkout. If not logged in, the customer gets forwarded to the \textit{LoginPage}. When successfully logged in, the customer clicks the \textit{BuyNow}-Button. The Sale process is finished as soon as the backend (CoCoME) has processed the sale.

\section{Using a Docker Environment} \label{Docker}

As shown in Fig. \ref{techStack}, using a Docker Environment affects the technology stack by adding additional layers. More detailed, the given CoCoME Stack is moved into the Docker Deamon, which runs a Linux distribution.The original parts of the stack, like Glassfish and the Java Virtual Machine, are still a part of the stack.
	
	\begin{figure}[!h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{img/tech_stack_CoCoME.png}
		\caption{Extended technology stack CoCoME}
		\label{techStack}
	\end{figure}
	
The Dockerfile defines an environment based on the latest version of Ubuntu 16:04. Maven, Git and Java are also installed using the standard Ubuntu package manager.\\
Git has two purposes: On the one hand it is used to download the most recent version of CoCoME.	On the other hand, it is used to download a prefabricated version of Glassfish that already includes domains and other adjustments required for CoCoME. Java is required by Glassfish and CoCoME as they need the Java Virtual Machine. Maven is needed to deploy the latest version of CoCoME onto the provided Glassfish servers.
	
	
	During the development, it was decided to implement and provide two different versions. The first version always pulls the most recent CoCoME source code from GitHub, downloads the entire dependencies with Maven, compiles and builds the project and finally deploys CoCoME on the Glassfish servers. As a consequence, creating and starting a Docker Container takes about one hour.\\
	In contrast, the second version only pulls a prefabricated version of CoCoME from GitHub. 
	Therefore, pulling the source code up to building the project is skipped. Maven does not have to be included in the technology stack. Solely, deploying CoCoME on the Glassfish server is necessary.\\
	This reduces the deployment time to a few minutes but has a disadvantage: The prefabricated version is updated manually. Therefore, it is sometime not the most recent version.\\
	By providing both, a fast deploying version and a current version, the user can choose what's the best for its situation.
	

	

	
\section{Microservices Technology} \label{MS}
	This section describes how the implementation of the usecases which are also implemented in the basic CoCoME version but also the general system design and the interaction of the microservices. In the following subsection \nameref{UsecaseSection} the realization details of different usecases is explained in detail. Further, the different usecases are allocated in the of the corresponding microservice. In the second subsection, named \nameref{archiOverviewMicro} the general architectural overview of the microservices is described.
	
	\subsection{Usecase implementation}\label{UsecaseSection}
	\FloatBarrier
		\subsubsection{Orders}
		This section describes the desgin of the \textit{Orders} microservice, which provides the main functionality for usecase 3 and usecase 4.\\
		
		\textbf{Behavioral View on UC 3 - Order Products} \\
		As shown in figure \ref{MS_UC3_1} and figure \ref{MS_UC3_2} this usecase is divided into two steps in the first step, user the frontend to create new OrderEntry elements. This elements are representing the different product entries at an order. It contains the informations about an the product to order and the ordering amount. They are saved in the Database until they are needed again in the second step again. 
		In the second step, the ProductOrder element is created. This Object represents the order itself, in detail information about the ordering store, the date on which this order is submitted and a collection with the OrderEntry objects of the products which are ordered in this order. Also it set in the OrderEntry objects an reference to this ProductOrder object.\\
		
		\textbf{Behavioral View on UC 4 - Receive Ordered Products} \\
		The figure %TD paste image with reference
		shows, the microservice first refreshes the store ProductOrder element and sets it delivery date to the in the call passed date.
		After this, it performs for each in the assigned a rest call to the store microservice in which the store itself is stored. With that rest call, the stockitems which are representing the corresponding product in the store are increasing their available amount of the product.

		\subsubsection{Stores}
		This section describes the design of the \textit{Store} microsevice, which provides the functionality of the usecases 1, 2, 7 and 8.
		
		\textbf{Behavioral View on UC 1 - Process Sale} \\
		The usecase 1 is pictured in figure \ref{MS_UC1_1} and \ref{MS_UC1_2}. As the figures divide that usecase into 2 parts this explanation will do to explain the process properly.
		In the first step, shown in figure \ref{MS_UC1_1} the process of adding product to the sale process is shown. To add Products to a sale, at first the sale mode has to be activated in the cash desk, which is done after the startSale action is executed. This also resets the CashDesk from previous, probably not finished and canceled sale processes.
		For adding products to the sale process, either the barcode can be scanned and submitted as one or can entered digit by digit. This barcode entering is shown in the first if construct in the loop of figure \ref{MS_UC1_1}.
		After scanning a barcode, it is checked if there is alreade an item was added to the sale and another ine is available in stock, or if there is an item with that barcode in the stock available. In the first case, the the stock amount of that item is reduced and that item is added to the inventory and the total amount is increased. In the second case, mostly the same is done, but instead of increasing the product amount in the inventory, there is an new product added to that inventory. Otherwise, the attempt of adding an product with that barcode is quit. Subsequently, the display is updated and this Product is added to the printer output.\\
		The second step of this usecase, shown in figure \ref{MS_UC1_2} handles the and of the sale process. The end is indicated by calling the finishSale routine, which represents pressing the finish sale button at the cashbox. After pressing that button, the display updated and it can be choosen, between paying by card or paying by cash. In both cases, first the cash desk is set to the corresponding paying mode, second the needed informations about the credit card or the overhanded cash amount is passed through. 
		After successfully ending the payment, the printer and display is updated and the cash desk ends the sale process.\\
		 
		
		\textbf{Behavioral View on UC 2 - Manage Express Checkout} \\
		Figure \ref{MS_UC2} shows, how each cash desk performs on an external call the updateExpressLight routine. In this, the cash desk checks by itself if based on the recently proceeded the Express light should be activated or not. In consequence, the express light is set to the correct value. \\
		
		\textbf{Behavioral View on UC 7 - Chane Price} \\
		As described in figure \ref{MS_UC7}, in a first step, the database element which represents the store, managed by the store manager who wants to change the price is loaded. On this, the in the store available products are filtered to find the one with the correct product id. 
		Having the correct StockItem found, the sale price of that object can be updated. Afterwards, the StockItem object is refreshed in the database.\\
		
		\textbf{Behavioral View on UC 8 - Product Exchange} \\
		The process on usecase 8 is shown in figure \ref{MS_UC8}. It starts at the end of an sale process. The microservice checks by itself if the stock amount of the sold items have reached their minimal amount. If not, nothing will happen. Otherwise, this information is passed to the appropriate EnterpriseManager. 
		This EnterpriseManager collects in an first step all of its stores, which are also selling this the specific product.
		If the EnterpriseManage has found at least one store which also provides that products, it figures out, which one of the possible exchange sources is the best. By reducing the stock amount of that product in this optimal store and increasing it in the store, which started the request, the product exchange is executed.

		This section describes the design of the \textit{Reports} microsevice, which provides the functionality of the usecases 5 and 6
		
		\textbf{Behavioral View on UC 5 and Uc 6 - Show Stock Report and Show Delivery Report} \\
		In the following, the realisation of usecase 5 and 6 are described. Usecase 5 is described in figure \ref{MS_UC5} and usecase 6 in figure \ref{MS_UC6}. 
		In both cases, this microservice performs an rest call to receive informations from the the corresponding microservices which contains the requested informations. this informations are returned on that request and were modified to represent the information in an proper format. That format is passed back to the calling frontend.
